# Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended)

# This app stores settings in localStorage by default
# However, setting these environment variables provides better UX

# ====================================
# RECOMMENDED: Default CSV URL
# ====================================
# Set this to pre-load verses for all users
# They can still change it in Settings
VITE_DEFAULT_CSV_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/YOUR_SHEET_ID/pub?output=csv

# ====================================
# RECOMMENDED: Default API Key
# ====================================
# API.Bible Key (get from https://scripture.api.bible)
# This will be used as the default key if users don't provide their own
# Get a free key at: https://scripture.api.bible/signup
VITE_BIBLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# ====================================
# How It Works
# ====================================
# If you set VITE_BIBLE_API_KEY:
# - Users can use Bible API features WITHOUT registering
# - Users see: "✅ Using default API key from server"
# - Power users can still enter their own key to override
#
# If you set VITE_DEFAULT_CSV_URL:
# - Users see verses immediately on first load
# - Users can still change the URL in Settings
# - Great for shared deployments or demos
#
# Note: All settings in localStorage will persist and override these defaults
