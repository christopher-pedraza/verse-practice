# Environment Variables (Optional)

# This app stores settings in localStorage by default
# You don't need environment variables for basic functionality

# However, if you want to pre-configure settings, you can use these:

# Google Sheets CSV URL (published as CSV)
# VITE_DEFAULT_CSV_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/YOUR_SHEET_ID/pub?output=csv

# API.Bible Key (get from https://scripture.api.bible)
# VITE_BIBLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Default Bible ID for API.Bible
# VITE_DEFAULT_BIBLE_ID=de4e12af7f28f599-02

# Note: Settings in localStorage will override these defaults
